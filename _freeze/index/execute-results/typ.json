Results from the study could not reject the null; aggregated external efficacy was apparently unresponsive across time to chosen predictors. Extending his analysis to include years since the original study partially replicates the original findings. Following the same methodology, updated results show that external efficacy in the aggregate is positively associated with presidential approval ratings with a one year lag. Similar to the previous results, statistical significance disappears upon inclusion of consumer sentiment and trust in government. Such results pose a severe challenge to the construst validity of measurement for external political efficacy. However, results from then and now are contestable on the grounds that the method of analysis does not appropriately test the hypotheses, and the predictors of the analysis are untenable as factors of the political environment. I attempt to conduct a fairer test of the same hypothesis through different methods and factors of the political environment.      \neditor_options: \n  chunk_output_type: console\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(12345)\n\n# load packages (those commented out may or may not be necessary)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.1     ✔ stringr   1.5.2\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.0     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.1.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(naniar) # data structures, summaries, and visuals for missing data\nlibrary(srvyr) # 'dplyr'-Like Syntax for summary statistics of survey data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'srvyr'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nlibrary(tinytable)\n\n# load some custom functions\nsource(here::here('utils', 'funs.R'))\n\n# load data in wide and long formats\nd <- readr::read_rds(file = \"data/replica data/replica_data_wide.rds\")\ndlong <- readr::read_rds(file = \"data/replica data/replica_data_long.rds\")\n\n\n# set `modelsummary` R package global options\n# options(modelsummary_factory_html = 'markdown')\n# options(modelsummary_factory_latex = 'kableExtra')\n\n# Replication data set\n\n# the `replica` data set is constrained to the data (presumably) available to\n# Chamberlain at the time\nreplica_long <- dlong |> dplyr::filter(year >= 1952 & year <= 2008)\n\nreplica <- d |> dplyr::filter(year >= 1952 & year <= 2008)\n```\n:::\n\n\n```{=typst}\n#show figure.caption: it => [\n    #v(-2em)\n    #set text(size:  0.95em, style: \"oblique\")\n    #align(left)[\n      #block(inset: 2em)[\n        #text(weight: \"bold\")[\n          #it.supplement\n          #context it.counter.display(it.numbering)\n          ]\n          #it.separator\n          #it.body\n          ]\n        ]\n      ]\n\n```\n\n## Introduction\n\nIt is not sufficiently clear what is being measured by external political efficacy measurement items. Not only is the conceptual definition of external efficacy conflated with similar concepts, empirical results are too closely related to satisfactorily distinguish external efficacy as a distinct component on par with internal political efficacy. @chamberlain2012 attempted to address this problem in the hopes that results would elucidate the meaning from the measurement.\n\n## Background (Literature Review)\n\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Replication of Figure 1 from @chamberlain2012\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n{{< embed notebooks/figure1_replication.qmd#fig-rep1 >}}\n\n:::\n\nIn the original article, the Y-axis of @fig-rep1 was not scaled to range from 0 to 100. Note also that the `NOSAY` external efficacy question was not asked in the 1986 ANES; A line for responses to the `NOSAY` question between 1984 and 1988 is drawn implicitly via linear interpolation.\n\nI extend the time-series chart to include the years of ANES data made available since Chamberlain's original study^[At the time of writing, preliminary data for ANES 2024 was available but not yet included in the Cumulative Data File.] \n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n{{< embed notebooks/figure1_replication.qmd#fig-rep1adj >}}\n\n:::\n\n## Replication of Figure 2 from @chamberlain2012\n\n@fig-rep2 charts plot lines of the three chosen predictors over time\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n{{< embed notebooks/figure2_replication.qmd#fig-rep2 >}}\n\n:::\n\nThe data available to Chamberlain at the time ranged from 1952 to 2008 for Presidential approval ratings (Gallup); 1960 to 2008 for quarterly ICS data (UMich), and of course, 1958 and 1964 to 2008 for trust in government (ANES). @fig-rep2 constrains the data to approximate the data available at the time of the original publication. \n\nThe following chart @fig-rep2adj is expanded to include all years for which data from each source was available^[Note that the Gallup monthly polling data was obtained through The Roper Center's iPoll database.]. In addition, no adjustment was made to the data and the Y-axis was expanded to preserve the full range of each variable. Values of the ICS are not constrained to range on a particular scale\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n{{< embed notebooks/figure2_replication.qmd#fig-rep2adj >}}\n\n:::\n\nNote the distinctive difference in ICS values between @fig-rep2 and @fig-rep2adj. In a footnote, Chamberlain states,\n\n> \"The Index of Consumer Sentiment was rescaled for figure 2 by subtracting 50 from all its values (to approximate a measure that would fit on a 100-point scale)\" [@chamberlain2012, 120, n7]\n\n@fig-rep2compare includes both the non-modified and modified versions of yearly average ICS values over time.\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n{{< embed notebooks/figure2_replication.qmd#fig-rep2compare >}}\n\n:::\n\nThe purpose of @fig-rep2 was not to visually compare average values of each variable. However, such a visualization inevitably presents as such. As stated by Chamberlain, the purpose of the chart was to demonstrate that, \"...across time, significant variation exists within these variables.\" [@chamberlain2012, 120]. \n\nUnderstandably, average values are difficult to compare across time due to the fact that they are not all measured on the same scale nor are they obtained by the same survey study. The Index of Consumer sentiment is calculated from a particular formula and then averaged by year; the Trust in Government index is a mean score composite of four question items where higher values indicate higher trust in government; and presidential approval ratings are yearly average approval ratings from monthly Gallup polls^[As an aside, I think the decision to rescale the ICS by subtracting 50 from the mean values for each year presents a chart that is visibly misleading. This visualization of the data as such easily presents a misleading comparison.].\n\n\n\n## Replication of Lagged Dependent Variable Model\n\nRecall @chamberlain2012's hypothesis was that, according to the conceptual definition of the construct, aggregate external efficacy would appear to be dynamically responsive to \"changes in the political environment\" [-@chamberlain2012, 120]. In order to test this hypothesis, he conducted a dynamic time-series analysis on aggregate external political efficacy from 1952 to 2008 by use of a lagged dependent variable OLS model. The dependent variable was the average index values for external efficacy aggregated across time from 1952 to 2008 (whenever ANES measured it). His independent variable predictors included presidential approval ratings, an index of consumer sentiment, trust in government, and a 4-year lag of the dependent variable external efficacy. Null results would invalidate, or at least challenge, the measurement of external efficacy and require re-consideration of both concept and measurement. Stated a bit more exhaustively, given the conceptual definition of external political efficacy, null results would invalidate the interpretation that results from the two survey items represent the construct external political efficacy.\n\nChamberlain reported that results could not reject null: aggregate external efficacy was unresponsive to the predictors across time. @tbl-1 is an attempt to replicate the same table from the original study [see -@chamberlain2012 123].\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-1 .cell .tbl-cap-location-bottom tbl-cap='Replica of Table 1 from Chamberlain (2012): \\'Lagged Dependent Variable Model of Macro-Level Variables on External Efficacy\\'.
