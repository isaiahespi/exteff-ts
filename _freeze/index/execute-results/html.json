Chamberlain [-@chamberlain2012] was one of a few who focused on external political efficacy and exposed substantive faults in both its conception and measurement. Rather than propose a new measurement or offer a new conceptual understanding, Chamberlain attempted to discern whether this individual-level construct was sensitive to external factors in the environment as would be expected given its conception and measurement. His research showed that aggregate external efficacy was not responsive to particular changes in the political environment. However, immediately brought into question is whether the predictors selected are reflective or representative of the external political environment in the first place. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\n## Conclusion\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n:::{#refs}\n\n:::",
