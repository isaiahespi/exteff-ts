Not only is the conceptual definition of external efficacy conflated with similar concepts, empirical results are too closely related to satisfactorily distinguish external efficacy as a distinct component on par with internal political efficacy. Drawing from the conventional conceptual definition of external efficacy, @chamberlain2012 hypothesized that external efficacy beliefs would be dynamically responsive to changes in the political environment. Results from the study could not reject the null; aggregated external efficacy was apparently unresponsive across time to chosen predictors. Extending his analysis to include years since the original study partially replicates the original findings. Following the same methodology, updated results show that external efficacy in the aggregate is positively associated with presidential approval ratings with a one year lag. Similar to the previous results, statistical significance disappears upon inclusion of consumer sentiment and trust in government. Such results pose a severe challenge to the construst validity of measurement for external political efficacy. However, results from then and now are contestable on the grounds that the method of analysis does not appropriately test the hypotheses, and the predictors of the analysis are untenable as factors of the political environment. I attempt to conduct a fairer test of the same hypothesis through different methods and factors of the political environment.     \n\neditor_options: \n  chunk_output_type: console\n---\n\n\n::: {.cell .hidden}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# set seed for reproducibility\nset.seed(12345)\n\n# load packages (those commented out may or may not be necessary)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.6\n✔ forcats   1.0.1     ✔ stringr   1.6.0\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.1     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.2\n✔ purrr     1.2.0     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(naniar) # data structures, summaries, and visuals for missing data\nlibrary(srvyr) # 'dplyr'-Like Syntax for summary statistics of survey data\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr .hidden}\n\n```\n\nAttaching package: 'srvyr'\n\nThe following object is masked from 'package:stats':\n\n    filter\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\nlibrary(modelsummary)\nlibrary(tinytable)\n\n# load some custom functions\nsource(here::here('utils', 'funs.R'))\n\n# load data in wide and long formats\nd <- readr::read_rds(file = \"data/replica data/replica_data_wide.rds\")\ndlong <- readr::read_rds(file = \"data/replica data/replica_data_long.rds\")\n\n\n# set `modelsummary` R package global options\n# options(modelsummary_factory_html = 'markdown')\n# options(modelsummary_factory_latex = 'kableExtra')\n\n# Replication data set\n\n# the `replica` data set is constrained to the data (presumably) available to\n# Chamberlain at the time\nreplica_long <- dlong |> dplyr::filter(year >= 1952 & year <= 2008)\n\nreplica <- d |> dplyr::filter(year >= 1952 & year <= 2008)\n```\n:::\n\n\n```{=typst}\n#show figure.caption: it => [\n    #v(-2em)\n    #set text(size:  0.95em, style: \"oblique\")\n    #align(left)[\n      #block(inset: 2em)[\n        #text(weight: \"bold\")[\n          #it.supplement\n          #context it.counter.display(it.numbering)\n          ]\n          #it.separator\n          #it.body\n          ]\n        ]\n      ]\n\n```\n\n## Introduction\n\nCritical scrutiny about the meaning and measure of external political efficacy beliefs has stagnated into comfortable waters. While much effort was expended to construct a reliable and valid measurement method for *internal* political efficacy [@craig1990; @craig1982; @niemi1991a], and later research bolstered its validation [@morrell2003], *external* political efficacy has not received the same critical focus despite its questionable validity. In fact, the two survey items used by the American National Election Studies (ANES) to construct the external political efficacy index have persisted relatively unchanged from the original \"sense of political efficacy\" measurement scale introduced by @campbell1954 in \"The Voter Decides\". While the two survey items have remained unchanged, the definition of external political efficacy has deviated substantially from that original concept of political efficacy and even seems divorced from the ordinary meaning of 'efficacy'.\n\nThe trouble with the meaning and measure of external political efficacy has not gone unnoticed in prior literature, but there's been little in terms of dedicated scrutiny. One notable effort by @chamberlain2012 stands out as a lonely attempt to validate external efficacy according to it conventional conception. Chamberlain posited that according to the definition of external efficacy, we would expect to see dynamic shifts in aggregate levels of external efficacy in accordance with changes in the political environment. Using aggregate data compiled from multiple sources, he conducted a dynamic time-series analysis on aggregate external political efficacy from 1952 to 2008. Specifically, his study utilized a time-series lagged dependent variable ordinary least squares (OLS) model. The dependent variable was the average index values for external efficacy aggregated across time. The independent variable predictors were aggregated averages of presidential approval ratings, the index of consumer sentiment, trust in government, and a 4-year lag of the dependent variable. The hypothesis was that aggregate external efficacy would appear to be dynamically responsive to the chosen predictors. Null results would suggest the measurement of external efficacy is invalid, and require re-consideration of both concept and measurement. Results could not reject null: aggregate external efficacy was unresponsive to the predictors across time.\n\nChamberlain's study stands as an uncommon way to test the construct validity of external efficacy that isn't reliant upon methods of common factor analysis or structural equation modeling (SEM). And it is appropriate considering that validating the measure of one construct largely depends on the proposed relations with other distinct constructs. Accordingly, Chamberlain's study was intended to test the construct validity of external political efficacy in reference to how it is understood, defined, and measured in political science and public opinion. However, while sensible, the study misses the mark in a few clear ways. Chamberlain's dynamic time series model with lagged dependent variable is insufficient to properly test the validity and congruence of both meaning and measurement of external efficacy. The theoretical justification for the method is lacking, the lags for the model appear arbitrary, but most importantly, the chosen predictors of the model are not tenable as factors representative of the political environment.\n\nDespite these flaws, the general idea that Chamberlain proposed was very sensible: if external political efficacy refers to an individual's belief about the *external* political environment, then we would expect to find that aggregate external efficacy beliefs across time shift upon changes to the political environment. Due to the aforementioned flaws in model and method, the theory and hypothesis still stand to be tested.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to attempt a fairer test of external political efficacy following Chamberlain's theoretical propositions. I attempt to replicate results from @chamberlain2012 and then extend them to include observations since the original study. I then address problems with the original study concerning the methods employed to test the theory as well as interpretation of results. In addition, I also examine whether predictors of Chamberlain's original model better relate to satisfaction with government or regime contentment. Then, I conduct a separate analysis with different predictors that, hopefully, serves as a more appropriate test. Using data from the 2016, 2020, and 2024 American National Election Studies (ANES), I examine whether external efficacy differs for panel respondents over time as political conditions differ between them and have changed around them. If external efficacy beliefs of the panel respondents are unresponsive to changes to their respective political conditions, then response data from the survey items cannot be validly interpreted as reflective of the construct according to the conventional definition.\n\n## Background (Literature Review)\n\nThe initial idea of political efficacy arose instrumentally as a concept for researchers aiming to explain political behavior---an explanation of behavior based on, or in, the psychology of the individual. The seminal book titled \"The Voter Decides\" by @campbell1954 introduced the concept and initial measure of political efficacy which they believed was related to political activity. These authors referred to this variable as \"sense of political efficacy\" and described it like this,\n\n> \"Sense of political efficacy may be defined as the feeling that individual political action does have, or can have, an impact upon the political process, i.e., that it is worth while to perform one's civic duties. It is the feeling that political and social change is possible, and that the individual citizen can play a part in bringing about this change.\" [@campbell1954, 187]\n\nThe original \"sense of political efficacy\" scale was measured by having respondents select either \"agree\" or \"disagree\" to the following survey items:\n\n1.  \"I don't think public officials care much what people like me think.\" [Disagree = 1] [NOCARE]\n2.  \"The way people vote is the main thing that decides how things are run in this country.\" [Agree = 1]\n3.  \"Voting is the only way that people like me can have any say about how the government runs things.\" [Disagree = 1] [VOTING]\n4.  \"People like me don't have any say about what the government does.\" [Disagree = 1] [NOSAY]\n5.  \"Sometimes politics and government seem so complicated that a person like me can't really understand what's going on.\" [Disagree = 1] [COMPLEX]\n\nAt this point, political efficacy was evaluated on the basis of its standing as a Guttman-type scale---as a unidimensional and unidirectional scale with a high coefficient of reproducibility[^1]. Although there were initially five items, the second \"The way people vote....\" item was dropped from the scale due to its relatively larger error compared to the other items[^2]. Except for this second item, disagreement with the rest of the item statements (NOSAY, NOCARE, VOTING, COMPLEX) was was thought to indicate one's \"sense of political efficacy\".\n\n[^1]: Guttman scales are also referred to as cumulative scales, where hierarchical arrangement of items suggests that agreement/disagreement with one statement implies agreement with with preceding statements. So for a multi-item scale of five statements with dichotomous response options $[0,1]$, a score of $4$ is on a scale of $0-5$. The coefficient of reproducibility reflects how closely a set of items reproduce a \"perfect scale\". From an individual's scale score alone we would be able to reproduce their pattern of responses to the items perfectly. Of course, we'd occasionally reproduce the wrong response pattern for each person, reflecting the percent of error in the scale. So if a scale has 10 percent error, then we would be able to reproduce their response choices 90 percent of the time. Hence, the coefficient of reproducibility, $C_{R} = 1 - \\frac{E}{N \\times I}$, where $E$ = sum of the observed response minus expected response, $N$ = number of respondents, and $I$ = number of items [See: @guttman1944; @ford1950; @jobling1961].\n\n[^2]: Ironically, the only survey item asking respondents to express whether the voter decides was dropped from the scale introduced in the book entitled \"The Voter Decides\".\n\nPositive relationship between one's \"sense of political efficacy\" and political participation was found and often replicated in subsequent studies [@agger1961; @campbell1960; @dahl1961]. This relationship held after controlling for education and a variety of demographic variables, leading the the authors to conclude that \"sense of political efficacy\" was, \"not merely a function of education or any other likely demographic factor\" (@campbell1954, 194).\n\nThe first intuitive conception of \"sense of political efficacy\", however, has been retired; a multidimensional conception of political efficacy now prevails. Today, political efficacy is conceived as an individual's attitude situated along two dimensions of belief. In one dimension, *internal political efficacy* refers to \"...beliefs about one's own competence to understand and to participate effectively in politics\" [@craig1990, 290; @niemi1991a, 1407]. The other dimension, *external political efficacy*, refers to \"...beliefs about the responsiveness of governmental authorities and institutions to citizen demands\" [@craig1990, 290; @niemi1991a, 1408]. It is said to be a mistake to refer to the two dimensions as comprising a single, cohesive attitudinal construct [@balch1974]. Thus separate sets of survey items have been devised specifically to measure either attitude as a distinct construct on its own.\n\nIn order to assess political efficacy beliefs along the internal dimension, researchers have survey participants indicate the extent to which they agree or disagree with at least four statements, where agreement indicates internal efficacy:\n\n1.  \"I consider myself well-qualified to participate in politics\" [SELFQUAL]\n2.  \"I feel I have a pretty good understanding of the important political issues facing our country\" [UNDRSTND]\n3.  \"I feel that I could do as good a job in public office as most other people\" [PUBOFF]\n4.  \"I think that I am better informed about politics and government as most people\" [INFORMED]\n\nA separate set of survey items are consistently utilized to estimate the extent of one's external efficacy beliefs, but in this case there are only two statements:\n\n1.  \"People like me don't have any say about what the government does.\" [NOSAY]\n2.  \"I don't think public officials care much what people like me think.\" [NOCARE]\n\nHistorically, survey respondents simply stated their agreement or disagreement with item statements above. Today, response options are usually expanded to include \"Strongly agree\", \"Strongly disagree\" and a middling option of \"Neither agree nor disagree\". For the external efficacy items, disagreement with either statement is thought to imply positive expression of external efficacy. The American National Election Studies (ANES) have included these two items in almost every survey wave since 1952, and responses are composed into an index of external political efficacy.\n\nThis two dimension conception of political efficacy has been generally accepted in the political science of public opinion and behavior. As such, when researchers refer to political efficacy in general terms, they are most often referring to, and including variable measures for, one of the two dimensions of political efficacy. \n\n## Theory-driven confirmations\n\nThe eventual empirical deconstruction of a \"sense of political efficacy\" into multiple dimensions of belief relied on various techniques that seemingly coincided with advances in political methodology and survey research. Validation of the internal and external dimensions of belief has been approached in more than a few ways: comparing relationships of item response data with other variables expected to be related in theory, i.e., external validation [@balch1974]; analysis of measurement reliability and stability of survey items, specifically test-retest reliability [@asher1974]; some form of factor analysis [@craig1982; @shingles1987; @craig1990; @acock1990; @niemi1991a], to include principal components analysis [@muller1970; @bowler2002], and path analysis techniques [@mcpherson1977]; and finally examination of over time change and correlation of item responses in the aggregate [@converse1972; @chamberlain2012]. Of these, the favored method used to validate the two dimensional construction of political efficacy has been factor analysis[^3].\n\n[^3]: Factor analysis is a multivariate statistical technique that falls under dimension reduction methods, alongside Principal Components analysis and multidimensional scaling, and is also used for the exploration of underlying latent structures within a data set. Broadly speaking, factor analysis encompasses two main approaches: Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). EFA attempts to identify any underlying factor structure of a set of observed variables without making any prior assumptions, i.e., *exploring* the factor structure that might underlie given data. Confirmatory factor analysis, in contrast, is theory driven. In CFA, a researcher hypothesizes the number of factors and patterns of factor loadings expected *a priori* (i.e., proposed in theory) and tests the fit of the factor model. In other words, the CFA approach tests the hypothesis that a set of items are associated with one or more specific factors. \n\nMost prominent in the literature are the empirical studies that have scrutinized the internal and external political efficacy items, alongside many others, by way of factor analysis techniques in order to determine whether response data could be validly interpreted according to a multitude of different conceptually distinct dimensions of political efficacy. Concerted analysis of the theoretical dimensions of political efficacy took off around the early 1970s, coinciding with advances in computational power and technology, as well as the advent of the Linear Structural Relations (LISREL) statistical program designed fit factor models to data based on maximum likelihood estimation [@joreskog1967; @joreskog1969]. Hence a slew of subsequent research into the meaning and measure of political efficacy conducted both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis, often by use of the LISREL statistical program [@craig1982; @finkel1985; @acock1985; @shingles1987; @clarke1989; @craig1990; @acock1990; @niemi1991a; @morrell2003]. However despite widespread use, this method of approach is still liable to reasonable criticism; in particular the subjectivity in the interpretation, and naming, of factors.\n\nFor instance, although the \"internal\" and \"external\" dimensions of political efficacy belief evidently became the conventional standard, the survey items that indicate these particular dimensions of beliefs have not been so clear cut. This lack of consensus is evidenced by competing literature that argued that the NOSAY and NOCARE item responses indicated *internal* efficacy, whereas two separate survey items better indicated \"external efficacy, i.e., perceptions of governmental responsiveness\" [@acock1990]. @acock1990 proposed the following survey items as alternatives purported to measure external efficacy:\n\n1.  \"How much do you feel that having elections makes the government pay attention to what the people think --- a good deal, some, or not much?\" [ELECRESP]\n2.  \"Over the years, how much attention do you feel the government pays to what people think when it decides what to do --- a good deal, some, or not much?\" [GOVRESP]\n\nIndeed, these alternate survey items are used by ANES to construct the *government responsiveness index* separate from the external efficacy index which is constructed from the aforementioned NOSAY and NOCARE survey items. Besides their assertion of face validity,  @acock1990's argument for these two items (ELECRESP, GOVRESP) as proposed measures of external efficacy defined interchangeably with government responsiveness was based on the reasoning that, \"...respondents are asked to evaluate if some aspect of the political system is receptive to citizen inputs\" [-@acock1990, 89]. The notion that NOSAY and NOCARE indicate internal efficacy, whereas ELECRESP and GOVRESP indicate external efficacy, was also based on evidence from prior research by the same authors utilizing methods of confirmatory factor analysis employing LISREL [@acock1985; @clarke1989].\n\nIn addition, with respect to scale construction for use in survey research methods, the number of survey items screened in NES pilot studies meant to test theoretically proposed factor structures of latent constructs (e.g., external political efficacy) did produce compelling results, but ultimately were inconsequential as the same NOSAY and NOCARE survey items remain the *de facto* items from which scholars routinely measure external efficacy. \n\nFor instance, using data from the NES 1987 pilot study @craig1990 analyzed results from a four-factor model of multiple survey items purported to indicate internal efficacy, incumbent trust, external efficacy, and regime trust/diffuse support [-@craig1990, see table 4 and table 5]. This revised four-factor solution was conducted after conducting an exploratory factor analysis on more than 35 survey items related to different conceptions of political efficacy and political trust. In the revised four-factor solution, four survey items loaded strongly onto a factor labelled external efficacy with factor loadings[^4] ranging from 0.60-0.73. These four items were as follows:\n\n1.  \"People like me don't have any say about what the government does.\" [NOSAY]\n2.  \"If public officials are not interested in hearing what the people think, there is really no way to make them listen.\" [MAKELSTN]\n3.  \"Under our form of government, the people have the final say about how the country is run, no matter who is in office.\" [FINALSAY]\n4.  \"There are many legal ways for citizens to successfully influence what the government does\" [LEGAL]\n\n[^4]: Factor loadings are weights that reflect the strength of the relationship between an observed item and the underlying factor. Factor loadings are interpreted much like correlation coefficients between the variables and factor that range from -1 to 1, where the absolute value indicates the strength to which the factor explains variance of the observed variable. \n\nAs can be seen, three of the above survey items purported to indicate external efficacy in @craig1990's revised four-factor solution differ from the two items that became the conventional standard for external efficacy in subsequent studies; nor does the ANES utilize these four items to compose the external political efficacy index.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the results from the competing CFA models appear compelling, even if conflicting, the lack of consensus in the literature was primarily conceptual, which highlights a notable flaw in relying too heavily on factor analysis methods for the sake of construct validation---the naming fallacy. We merely name a factor \"internal efficacy\" when it just as easily can be called anything else without clear and sufficient conceptual justification. Factor loadings may reflect the strength of the relationship between variable and factor, but the interpretation of that factor is not also given. The only cogent justification for a particular nominal moniker (name) would be its semantic coherence in ordinary language. Yet, this coherence is not simply established \"on the face of it\", but regards the logical coherence between the conceptual meaning of the concept and its operative measurement.     \n\nHowever the trajectory of this history was to develop and validate a reliable and robust method of measurement for *internal* political efficacy. External political efficacy was assumed to be the default dimension of political efficacy, and thus there was far less concern or interest in further explicating the concept beyond \"feelings of government responsiveness\". \n\nThe end result is that the internal political efficacy scale consists of four survey items entirely distinct from the original \"sense of political efficacy\" four-item battery, whereas external efficacy retains two items from the original scale virtually unchanged. \n\n\n\n   \nEven when two factors are confirmed, factor loadings on the two items purported to measure external political efficacy are weak \n\nThe consequences of this are subtle but prevalent within political science literature. Although the multidimensional conception of political efficacy beliefs has been generally accepted, researchers still confuse the distinction between the two dimensions. A brief review of a recent publication demonstrates the issue quite well [@trexler2025]. Theoretical expectations of what should influence internal or external efficacy do not logically follow the given conceptions stated in the same literature. In other cases, the absence of a coherent conception of political efficacy functions as a blank canvas for researchers to instrumentally derive and develop novel political efficacy constructs which only inherit unresolved issues of meaning and measurement [@lee2006; @gildezuniga2017; @phoenix2024]. Moreover, limitations and inadequacies of conventional survey measurement items consistently hamper or constrain political scientists. This is shown by the fact that quite often researchers will append novel, yet un-validated, survey items of their own onto the conventional multi-item scales for internal and external efficacy [@wolak2018]. Thus a slew of unique renditions of external political efficacy grow within the literature, only to inherit the same feeble conceptual foundation[^5].\n\n[^5]: This is not limited to political studies of opinion and behavior; novel, conflicting, or sometimes redundant, efficacy constructs emerge and proliferate across many disciplines. [see @skurka2023; @hamann2024]\n\nThe bad news here is that external political efficacy is, and has been, conceptually ambiguous and easily conflated, which leads to inevitable problems in measurement and a severe challenge to any notion of construct validity. It is questionable that the two standard external efficacy items measure what scholars profess they measure, and worse, it isn't clear *what* these two items are supposed to measure in the first place. It is not clear is whether external efficacy is a belief about perceived government responsiveness or a belief about public capacity to influence government officials given conditions of the political environment. In almost all cases, however, external political efficacy is never defined as beliefs about the *efficacy of political action* as popular means to effectuate change or shape the political environment. Consequently, this confusion shows up in related literature. Indeed, there are multiple instances in past literature where researchers have emphasized that the context of the political environment is inherent to the concept and important to take into consideration, but then carry on to survey beliefs about satisfaction with government [@coleman1976], or they assess whether individuals feel descriptively represented in government.\n\nEspecially as a construct distinct from, but related to, a multitude of other attitudinal constructs. On the one hand, external political efficacy is expected to correlate with internal political efficacy, but remain distinct enough from it that it falls along its own dimension, hence the \"internal\" and \"external\" distinction of political efficacy. At the same time, external efficacy is also expected to relate to a variety of other political attitudes such as trust in government but not so much as to be conflated.\n\n\n\n## Data & Methods {#sec-data-methods}\n\nI cannot be entirely sure that the data I have matches or even approximates the presidential approval ratings data he employed in the original analysis. I've documented the process I undertook to gather, process, and compile the data elsewhere.\n\n## Replication of Figure 1 from @chamberlain2012\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n{{< embed notebooks/figure1_replication.qmd#fig-rep1 >}}\n\n:::\n\nIn the original article, the Y-axis of @fig-rep1 was not scaled to range from 0 to 100. Note also that the `NOSAY` external efficacy question was not asked in the 1986 ANES; A line for responses to the `NOSAY` question between 1984 and 1988 is drawn implicitly via linear interpolation.\n\nI extend the time-series chart to include the years of ANES data made available since Chamberlain's original study^[At the time of writing, preliminary data for ANES 2024 was available but not yet included in the Cumulative Data File.] \n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n{{< embed notebooks/figure1_replication.qmd#fig-rep1adj >}}\n\n:::\n\n## Replication of Figure 2 from @chamberlain2012\n\n@fig-rep2 charts plot lines of the three chosen predictors over time\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n{{< embed notebooks/figure2_replication.qmd#fig-rep2 >}}\n\n:::\n\nThe data available to Chamberlain at the time ranged from 1952 to 2008 for Presidential approval ratings (Gallup); 1960 to 2008 for quarterly ICS data (UMich), and of course, 1958 and 1964 to 2008 for trust in government (ANES). @fig-rep2 constrains the data to approximate the data available at the time of the original publication. \n\nThe following chart @fig-rep2adj is expanded to include all years for which data from each source was available^[Note that the Gallup monthly polling data was obtained through The Roper Center's iPoll database.]. In addition, no adjustment was made to the data and the Y-axis was expanded to preserve the full range of each variable.

In a footnote, Chamberlain states,\n\n> \"The Index of Consumer Sentiment was rescaled for figure 2 by subtracting 50 from all its values (to approximate a measure that would fit on a 100-point scale)\" [@chamberlain2012, 120, n7]\n\n@fig-rep2compare includes both the non-modified and modified versions of yearly average ICS values over time.\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n{{< embed notebooks/figure2_replication.qmd#fig-rep2compare >}}\n\n:::\n\nThe purpose of @fig-rep2 was not to visually compare average values of each variable. However, such a visualization inevitably presents as such. As stated by Chamberlain, the purpose of the chart was to demonstrate that, \"...across time, significant variation exists within these variables.\" [@chamberlain2012, 120]. \n\nUnderstandably, average values are difficult to compare across time due to the fact that they are not all measured on the same scale nor are they obtained by the same survey study. The Index of Consumer sentiment is calculated from a particular formula and then averaged by year; the Trust in Government index is a mean score composite of four question items where higher values indicate higher trust in government; and presidential approval ratings are yearly average approval ratings from monthly Gallup polls^[As an aside, I think the decision to re-scale the ICS by subtracting 50 from the mean values for each year presents a chart that is visibly misleading. This visualization of the data as such easily presents a misleading comparison.].\n\n\n\n## Replication of Lagged Dependent Variable Model\n\nRecall @chamberlain2012's hypothesis was that, according to the conceptual definition of the construct, aggregate external efficacy would appear to be dynamically responsive to \"changes in the political environment\" [-@chamberlain2012, 120]. In order to test this hypothesis, he conducted a dynamic time-series analysis on aggregate external political efficacy from 1952 to 2008 by use of a lagged dependent variable OLS model. The dependent variable was the average index values for external efficacy in the aggregate and across time from 1952 to 2008. His independent variable predictors included presidential approval ratings, an index of consumer sentiment, trust in government, and a 4-year lag of the dependent variable external efficacy. Null results would invalidate, or at least challenge, the measurement of external efficacy and require re-consideration of both concept and measurement. Stated a bit more exhaustively, given the conceptual definition of external political efficacy, null results would invalidate the interpretation that results from the two survey items represent the construct external political efficacy.\n\nChamberlain reported that results could not reject null: aggregate external efficacy was unresponsive to the predictors across time. I attempted to replicate[^6] the same table of results from the original study [see -@chamberlain2012 123].\n\n[^6]: Note that I did not attempt to replicate 'Model 5' from the original publication.

This shouldn't be the case since the data should be exactly the same\n```\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n@tbl-1 almost replicates the published results from @chamberlain2012, but with minor differences. The regression coefficients and standard errors are not identical[^7], but very close. However the number of observations for Model 4 differs by one for unknown reasons. The ANES data from the Cumulative Data File (CDF) is identical to the data employed in Chamberlain's study, and as such, Models 1 and 4 from @tbl-1 should not differ from the same models in the original publication. After many arduous attempts, I was unable to discern exactly why the two models differed. \n\nIn the original publication, Chamberlain noted that, \"Presidential approval came close to significance as the lone predictor ($p = 0.068$) but was weakened considerably when the index [ICS] and trust were included.\" [-@chamberlain2012, 122]. The case is similar for replication of Model 3 in @tbl-1; a one-year lag of presidential approval is also significant at the 90\\% confidence level ($p = 0.0700$).\n\n[^7]: It is very likely that the data for Presidential approval and Index of Consumer Sentiment I managed to gather for this replication effort differs just enough to explain the slight difference in regression coefficients and standard errors from Table 1 of the original study. Since replication data files were not available to me, I manually sourced and compiled all the data myself from each respective source following the information provided in the original study. \n\n\n### Incorporating Years since 2008\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-2 .cell .tbl-cap-location-bottom tbl-cap='Replication of Table 1 results from @chamberlain2012, including years since original publication.'}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# Table 1 of Chamberlain extended out to 2024 \n\n# remove ics_modified var\nd <- d |> dplyr::select(-ics_modified)\n\n# exclude years prior to 1952 and beyond 2024\nd <- d |> \n  dplyr::filter(year >= 1952, year <= 2024)\n\n# NOTE: the lagged DV `exteff.T4` refers to the value of external efficacy at\n# t-4, which is four years prior.

confidence level ($p = 0.0206$), even when a four-year lag of the dependent variable is included in the model. However including one-year lags of the ICS ($t-1$) in Model 5 renders a one-year lag of presidential approval ($t-1$) significant at 90\\% confidence ($p = 0.055$). In Model 6, average presidential approval lagged by one-year is statistically insignificant along with all other predictors of the full model.\n\nHowever, incorporating data from years since 2008 doesn't change anything for Model 4 in @tbl-2 which remains identical to the same model in @tbl-1 despite the fact that at least four ANES surveys have taken place since 2008. This is due to the fact that average trust-in-government is lagged by two-years. This leaves Model 4 with 20 observations in the aggregate covering only the years from 1966 to 2004.\n\nFor some reason, Chamberlain decides to lag the dependent variable by four years but lags the trust-in-government predictor by two years. Starting from 1964 up until 2004, both external efficacy and trust in government were measured every two years, but ANES surveys have been conducted in four-year intervals ever since. Justification for the different lags for external efficacy and trust-in-government is not provided by Chamberlain nor is the reasoning obvious. \n\nSince external efficacy was measured at an irregular interval, the lag of 4 years is difficult to justify in theory. This 4-year lag ignores external efficacy in periods where there was not a general election even though external efficacy was measured every two years from 1964 up until 2004. The idea is that prior levels of external efficacy influence subsequent levels of external efficacy, but a lag of four years skips years where external efficacy and trust in government was measured by ANES surveys during midterm election cycles. That being said, however, a two-year lag of external efficacy also isn't appropriate. Indeed, the aggregated average of external efficacy in 2024 was $25.1$, but given a two-year lag and that value is null. \n\nComplicating matters is the tenuous distinction between trust-in-government and external efficacy, conceptually, empirically, and in regards to survey measurement. Given the conceptual overlap between trust-in-government and external political efficacy, it has not been well established that the items measuring one are not also capturing the other.  \n\n### Lagged by Prior Observed Value\n\nSince the general idea is that prior values of aggregated external efficacy account for a portion of subsequent values of the same, then it seems reasonable enough to simply regress external efficacy on the prior observed values of itself instead of its value four years prior. This resolves the issue of measurements taken at irregular intervals over time.\n\nI run the same analysis lagging the dependent variable by it's preceding value, i.e., the average index value of the previous ANES survey iteration. Moreover, I lag the average trust-in-government by its preceding value as well for the models that include the aggregated index.\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n\n::: {#tbl-3 .cell .tbl-cap-location-bottom tbl-cap='Replication of Table 1 results from @chamberlain2012, including years since original publication.

variable attain statistical significance. If we choose to understand external political efficacy as beliefs about the responsiveness of government to citizen demands, these results provide us with no supporting information that the survey items validly measure the construct. That is, the public's attitudes about the consumer economy and presidential approval last year, nor the most recent measures of trust in government, seem to bear any weight upon survey items purported to function as measures of beliefs about the responsiveness of government and institutions to citizen demands or preferences. To put in other words, the two items---NOSAY and NOCARE---are not measuring what we think they measure. This was Chamberlain's conclusion implied at the end of his research note. And yet, what we think the items measure is semantically, conceptually, or otherwise sensibly unrelated to a coherent conception of external political efficacy. In fact, it isn't unambiguously clear exactly what it is that political scholars aim to measure in the first place with respect to external political efficacy. The conventional understanding of external political efficacy is misconstrued as government responsiveness and attempts at its measurement are evidently malformed. In fact, research published about decade ago presents a persuasive case for maintaining a clear distinction between external political efficacy and perceived government responsiveness [@esaiasson2015].\n\n## Conclusion: The Bigger Problem\n\n*Efficacy* is a noun. Ordinarily, efficacy refers to the capacity to produce some intended result or outcome. *External political efficacy* is a noun (rather, a noun phrase). The conventional meaning of external political efficacy refers to a belief about the responsiveness of government officials and institutions to public demands---or better said as public influence attempts. Juxtaposing the meanings together like this illustrates that external political efficacy has diverged from having a basic semantic connection with the ordinary meaning of 'efficacy'. Although ordinary meanings do not authoritatively prescribe meaning, external political efficacy is a technical term in political science that is divorced from what it would appear to mean on its face. \n\nSo when we talk about the efficacy of some thing or act, we're discussing the maximum effect of some intervention or stimulus on something else. To say that we appraise the efficacy of something or some act is to say that we are evaluating the capacity of the means toward an explicit end. For instance, researchers of medicine may evaluate the efficacy of some treatment or medical intervention toward the ends of treatment---e.g., vaccine efficacy reveals the capacity of a vaccine to prevent a particular infection or disease. When it comes to external political efficacy as it is defined and understood, we are discussing the extent that one believes the government to be responsive to public demands, preferences, interests, or the like. The intended aim is apparently to induce response from government and the supposed intervention is public influence attempts.\n\nThe problem is not simply that we're referring to something by the wrong name. The problem is that the conception of the construct is also detached from the items purported to measure it, and results of those measures do not permit an interpretation coherent with the conventional theory of the concept nor with an improved conception of external political efficacy better aligned with the nominal meaning of the word 'efficacy'.\n\nIn broader terms, the problem is that political scholars do not have valid ways to ascertain what we want to know. Ultimately, external efficacy items are uninformative in this regard. More broadly, however, the problem extends to internal political efficacy as well. The measures of internal and external political efficacy do not tell us whether one believes that individual political action is worthwhile, whether political action matters, whether and to what extent active political engagement imposes any influence on the actions of governing actors, nor whether public intervention results in political outcomes. The important part is that, taken together or separately, neither external nor internal efficacy measures tell us the maximum effect of individual nor popular political activity from the perspective of the subject. This means that neither are tenable as evaluations of political efficacy.\n\nFor interested researchers, the conventional measures of political efficacy do not nor can not inform us as whether the impact of public intervention, if any, would be recognizable as such from the perspective of the public. This point requires emphasis: scholars are unable to evaluate whether an individual, and by extension the mass public, believes in the efficacy of their own political participation. Consequently, scholars are also unable to evaluate whether the public is sensitive to substantial changes to the political environment; in particular to conditions that pertain to the people's capacity to produce political outcomes, to impose influence, or even to participate as political actors. That is, we're unable to ascertain whether the people's political efficacy beliefs are sensitive to the conditions of their political environment because we have not viable methods to assess those political efficacy beliefs in the first place.\n\nIn order to resolve the issue of external efficacy, our conceptual understanding of it must first be addressed and scrutinized. We don't know what we're measuring if we do not have a clear, concise, and distinct conception of it (whatever it is). Especially in relation to the supposed contrast, internal efficacy. Whether that relationship is both coherent and valid is not purely an empirical matter that can be resolved through complex measurement methodology or creative use of the methods of statistical inference. We first must be clear about what it is we mean when we refer to this concept in theory, which, in turn, means that the theory of the concept itself must be valid on its own terms. \n\nWe must understand what we want to know, which is fundamental to scientific inquiry. When we select a measurement instrument, it is presumed that we have clearly identified what we'd like to know because of what results the measurement instrument can produce. When I want to know how much I weigh, I use the appropriate measurement instrument that reliably provides me with valid results corresponding to my weight in an appropriate unit metric for (e.g., pounds lbs, kilos, grams).  \n\nPolitical efficacy beliefs *should* tell us whether the public is sensitive to the conditions in which they are subject. Political efficacy should tell us whether the people believe themselves capable by the means available, not just to influence governors, but to shape conditions of the political environment as governing actors themselves. If the public is not sensitive to changing political conditions, then they would not recognize when they are subjected to authoritarian regimes and oppressive conditions. Indeed, the people may not recognize themselves as subject at all despite the fact. Democracy, then, is nothing more than a utopia of impotence.\n\n:::{.place arguments='top, scope: \"parent\", float: true'}\n\n## References {.unnumbered}\n\n:::{#refs}\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## Appendix
