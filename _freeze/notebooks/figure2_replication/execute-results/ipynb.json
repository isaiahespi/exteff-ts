However, such a visualization inevitably presents as such. As stated by Chamberlain, the purpose of the chart was to demonstrate that, \"...across time, significant variation exists within these variables.\" [@chamberlain2012, 120]. \n\nUnderstandably, average values are difficult to compare across time due to the fact that they are not all measured on the same scale nor are they obtained by the same survey study. The Index of Consumer sentiment is calculated from a particular formula and then averaged by year; the Trust in Government index is a mean score composite of four question items where higher values indicate higher trust in government; and presidential approval ratings are yearly average approval ratings from monthly Gallup polls. However, simple methods exist for comparing means of variables measured on different scales; standardizing each variable might permit better visualization to compare variation in distribution across time.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# extended replica of Figure 2, standard values to z-scores (center at mean = 0\n# with standard deviation = 1)\ndlong |>\n  # exclude average values for external efficacy index and ics (modified)\n  dplyr::filter(!variable %in% c(\"exteff\", \"ics_modified\")) |>\n  # adjust values to mirror data available to Chamberlain at the time \n  dplyr::mutate(value = dplyr::case_when(\n    variable %in% c(\"presapp\") & year <= 1952 ~ NA,\n    .default = value\n  )) |>\n  tidyr::drop_na(value) |> \n  dplyr::group_by(variable) |> \n  dplyr::mutate(\n    value_z = scale(value) |> as.vector()) |> \n  ggplot2::ggplot(aes(x = year, y = value_z, linetype = variable, colour = variable)) +\n  ggplot2::geom_line() +\n  ggplot2::geom_hline(yintercept = 0, color = \"darkred\")+\n  # ggplot2::geom_point(mapping = aes(colour = variable))+\n  ggplot2::scale_linetype_manual(\n    values = c(\n      \"ics\" = \"solid\",\n      \"presapp\" = \"dashed\",\n      \"trustgov\" = \"twodash\"\n    ),\n    labels = c(\n      \"ics\" = \"ICS\",\n      \"presapp\" = \"Presidential Approval\",\n      \"trustgov\" = \"Trust in Government\"\n    )\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::scale_discrete_manual(\n    aesthetics = c(\"colour\"),\n    values = c(\n      \"ics\" = \"red\",\n      \"presapp\" = \"seagreen\",\n      \"trustgov\" = \"royalblue\"))+\n  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(\n    limits = c(1950, 2025),\n    breaks = seq(1950, 2025, by = 5),\n    expan = ggplot2::expansion(0.01, 0.01)\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(\n    # expansion controls padding at limit y-axis limits\n    expand = ggplot2::expansion(0.01, 0.01)\n    ) +\n  ggplot2::labs(\n    caption = stringr::str_wrap(\"Variables have been centered to mean = 0 and a standard deviation = 1.

On visual inspection of @fig-rep2 in the original publication, the average values for aggregate consumer sentiment across time appear far lower than the actual average values derived from the same data. The variable isn't transformed, but rather the actual values of the data are modified. This was done for the sake of fitting the data to range on a scale between 0 to 100. This seems fine, but the method of modification seems arbitrary. Transforming the variables to range from 0 to 100 through normalization (i.e., a min-max scaling procedure) would, indeed, constrain all variables to the same scale but also present a misleading visual of aggregate averages across time. Although this Figure alone was not the point of the study, the visualization of the data as such easily presents a misleading comparison.\n",
