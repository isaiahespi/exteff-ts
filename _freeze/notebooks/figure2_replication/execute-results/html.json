However, such a visualization inevitably presents as such. As stated by Chamberlain, the purpose of the chart was to demonstrate that, \"...across time, significant variation exists within these variables.\" [@chamberlain2012, 120]. \n\nUnderstandably, average values are difficult to compare across time due to the fact that they are not all measured on the same scale nor are they obtained by the same survey study. The Index of Consumer sentiment is calculated from a particular formula and then averaged by year; the Trust in Government index is a mean score composite of four question items where higher values indicate higher trust in government; and presidential approval ratings are yearly average approval ratings from monthly Gallup polls. \n\nAs an aside, I think his decision to re-scale the ICS by subtracting 50 from the mean value for each year presents a chart that is visibly misleading. On visual inspection of @fig-rep2 in the original publication, the average values for aggregate consumer sentiment across time appear far lower than the actual average values derived from the un-adjusted data. Transforming the values of the data keeps the data intact, but in this case, the average ICS values for each year were all subtracted by 50 for the sake of fitting the data to range on a scale between 0 to 100. This may be fine but to me seems questionable; the average values across time are arbitrarily lowered on the y-axis which easily presents a misleading comparison of the values across time.\n\n\n\n",
