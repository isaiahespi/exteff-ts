This function is useful in particular for `tbl_svy` objects and relies on the `srvyr` R package. This function is a slightly modified version of a similar one found [here](https://tidy-survey-r.github.io/tidy-survey-book/c05-descriptive-analysis.html#example-3-purrrmap).\n\nIn other words, I create a function that will return the proportion of responses by year, and since I have applied the appropriate weights provided in the ANES cumulative data file using the `srvyr` R package, the function also returns the standard error for each estimate.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code .hidden}\n# create function that returns a table of response proportions for a single\n# variable (factor) by grouping variable, i.e., proportions of `var` conditional\n# to `group_var`\n# this function is a modified version of the one from the following url\n# (https://tidy-survey-r.github.io/tidy-survey-book/c05-descriptive-analysis.html#example-3-purrrmap)\n\ncalcps <- function(dat, var, group_var) {\n  { dat } |>  \n    srvyr::drop_na(!!rlang::sym(var)) |> \n    srvyr::group_by(!!rlang::sym(group_var), !!rlang::sym(var)) |> \n    srvyr::summarize(prop = srvyr::survey_prop(proportion = TRUE) * 100) |> \n    srvyr::mutate(Variable = stringr::str_to_upper(var)) |> \n    srvyr::rename(Response := !!rlang::sym(var)) |> \n    srvyr::select(!!rlang::sym(group_var), Variable, everything())\n}\n```\n:::\n\n\nI create two tables of proportions for both the `NOCARE` and `NOSAY` external political efficacy items conditioned on the year of the ANES. Then, I bind the rows of the two tables together, which basically stacks one table atop the other, and assign this as a named object `resp_tab_by_year`. This combined table organizes the date into long format, where each row is a response to the particular question item by year.
