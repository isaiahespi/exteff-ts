In the American case the structure of the model is invariant by race, gender and political context, and the relative strength of correlations between the efficacy factors and measures of personal competence and perceived government responsiveness agrees with theoretical expectations. Although the SRC items appear to be useful measures of efficacy, simple equally weighted additive indices such as those utilized by the SRC itself are inadequate.

Consistent with previous theorizing, the internal efficacy factor is significantly more stable than the external factor. Also, the two efficacy factors correlate as expected with measures of general personal competence and political trust. The paper is the first to use LISREL structured means tests to test group differences in levels of efficacy or other important political attitudes.

Two test-retest coefficients are examined: the product-moment correlation, and the percentage of inconsistent responses. A number of possible causes of the low reliabilities are examined. An attempt to attribute the low reliability coefficients for 1968 to systematic attitude change produced by the election outcome is unsuccessful. Some evidence is presented suggesting that the low reliabilities may be due in part to the measurement of non-attitudes. Combining the efficacy items into an index scarcely increases the reliabilities. Finally, an external approach to reliability is briefly considered.},

The assumptions of the proposed model are invariant to the scaling of the outcome. We provide conditions under which the model is nonparametrically identified and propose an estimator that can be applied using either repeated cross section or panel data. Our approach provides an estimate of the entire counterfactual distribution of outcomes that would have been experienced by the treatment group in the absence of the treatment and likewise for the untreated group in the presence of the treatment. Thus, it enables the evaluation of policy interventions according to criteria such as a mean--variance trade-off. We also propose methods for inference, showing that our estimator for the average treatment effect is root-N consistent and asymptotically normal. We consider extensions to allow for covariates, discrete dependent variables, and multiple groups and time periods.},

Democrats and Republicans view election laws through a partisan lens, which is especially triggered when coalitions lose. Republican voters see ballot restrictions as a means of securing the vote against fraud; Democratic voters see ballot restrictions as voter suppression. We maintain that the conditional partisan effect that election laws have on voter confidence is triggered or attenuated when partisans' candidates lose elections. We find that in states where ballot access is costly, voter confidence among partisans and supporters of the losing Presidential candidate is significantly higher for Republicans and significantly lower for Democrats than their counterparts in states with less costly ballot access laws. These effects are greater for Republican than Democrats. We discuss the implications of our findings on election ecosystems and voter confidence.},

This applies the logic of (Campbell and Fiske's) multitrait-multimethod matrix and (Cronbach and Meehl's) construct validation to survey research. It is found that the efficacy items are not equivalent with respect to theoretically relevant external variables. Efficacy scale scores mask theoretically significant differences among items. This requires decomposing the scale and reformulating the concept into at least two aspects: "internal" (related to theories of participatory democracy and personality) and "external" (related to theories of system persistence). It is argued that all research which uses composite indices be analyzed by some method like multiple item analysis, with special focus on item equivalence.]},

This theory states that psychological procedures, whatever their form, alter the level and strength of self-efficacy. It is hypothesized that expectations of personal efficacy determine whether coping behavior will be initiated, how much effort will be expended, and how long it will be sustained in the face of obstacles and aversive experiences. Persistence in activities that are subjectively threatening but in fact relatively safe produces, through experiences of mastery, further enhancement of self-efficacy and corresponding reductions in defensive behavior. In the proposed model, expectations of personal efficacy are derived from 4 principal sources of information: performance accomplishments, vicarious experience, verbal persuasion, and physiological states. Factors influencing the cognitive processing of efficacy information arise from enactive, vicarious, exhortative, and emotive sources. The differential power of diverse therapeutic procedures is analyzed in terms of the postulated cognitive mechanism of operation. Findings are reported from microanalyses of enactive, vicarious, and emotive modes of treatment that support the hypothesized relationship between perceived self-efficacy and behavioral changes.

Multilevel analysis examines the role of their socioeconomic status, civic resources, and sociopolitical learning for internal efficacy achievement. The findings identify sociopolitical learning mechanisms that differently interact with individual background to contribute to political efficacy and political equality: experiences in a politically active community, acquiring skills for political action, engaging in political discourse, and inclusion in collaborative pluralist contexts. These aspects of political learning can enhance efficacy and reduce the influence of largely unchosen political advantages, creating an alternative pathway to political empowerment.},

This paper investigates the proposition that income inequality leads to increased democratic distrust by depressing perceptions of external efficacy. Based on time-series cross-sectional survey data from the European Social Survey, we find that changes in income inequality have a negative effect on changes in political trust and external efficacy. Causal mediation analysis confirms that inequality affects trust through lower efficacy. Further analyses show that this efficacy-based mechanism does not depend on political orientation. As a direct effect remains among left-wing respondents, our empirical results indicate that inequality affects trust via both a mechanism of substantive output evaluation and a process-based evaluation that measures of external efficacy can capture. These findings highlight the empirical and theoretical relevance of this so far neglected mechanism and provide a potential solution for the puzzle that inequality depresses trust also among those for whom inequality is not politically salient.},

If participatory institutions have an `educative role' that shapes perceptions of government, then citizens exposed to direct democracy may be more likely to claim they understand politics and be more likely to perceive that they are capable of participation. They may also be more likely to perceive that government is responsive to them. We merge data on state-level political institutions with data from the 1992 American National Election Study to test these hypotheses with OLS models. Our primary hypotheses find support. We present evidence that the effects of exposure to direct democracy on internal and external political efficacy rival the effects of formal education.},

Each iteration is a distinct sample, as opposed to panels in which the same people are interviewed two or more times. By asking the same questions on repeated survey samples from the same population, RCS studies allow us to track trends and to establish causal inferences. One analytic challenge is to maintain both the representativeness and the comparability of samples as fieldwork methods or sources change. The longer the span covered by an RCS, the likelier it is that the universe will change. For an RCS spanning decades, populations can change in fundamental ways. The universe of content also changes, as issues of one period are redefined or even rendered irrelevant in another. Extracting trends from RCS data typically requires smoothing to separate signal from noise, especially where samples or subsamples are small, but this can lead to bias due to excessive smoothing or to mistaking noise for signal because of sampling variability when there is not enough smoothing. By deploying time the RCS design enables certain kinds of causal inference, but many alternative micro-processes are observationally equivalent, and so the RCS benefits from being combined with the panel design.},

In this study, a lagged dependent variable model is used to test the measure from an aggregate and dynamic perspective.

With data from the Children of the National Longitudinal Study of Youth, we examine the effect of general self-efficacy on voting behavior among young, first-time voters. We find that general self-efficacy has a positive effect on voter turnout, and this effect is strongest for young people from low socioeconomic-status families.},

  abstract = {In the analysis presented in the present report, we have focused on the question of the position of the sense of effectiveness in the individual's psychological structure. In the first section the question posed is that of the generality of effectiveness as a psychological characteristic; in the second we present an analysis of certain projective materials in an effort to clarify the relationship of this attitudinal variable to two ego-level personality factors. Data for the analysis were derived from a personal interview survey conducted with 316 members of the labor force population of Detroit. The interview for the present study was administered only to members of the sample who were employed, seeking employment, or only temporarily unemployed. The central notion of this section of our analysis was that, in general, individuals who feel effective in the public sphere will be characterized by greater feelings of security in the personal environment as well. The sense of effectiveness in response to public affairs has been shown to be related to a feeling of competence in a variety of areas in the more immediate sphere of personal affairs. The order of magnitude of relationships demonstrated and the consistency of these relations appear to justify the interpretation that the sense of political effectiveness is to a significant extent a reflection of a more general psychological competence. In analysis of the TAT protocols we find again evidence that respondents who do not feel competent have less optimistic expectations about the world around them. The sense of effectiveness in public affairs has been shown to be moderately but consistently related to a feeling of competence in a variety of areas in the more immediate environment of personal affairs. The primary conclusion we draw from the total study concerns the role of ego processes as mediating variables in the determination of social attitudes. This question is of interest both because of the general scientific goal of understanding attitude determination, and also because of its implications for the practical problem of producing change.

  abstract = {In Shelby County v. Holder (570 U.S. 529 (2013)), the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the ``coverage formula'' in Section 4b of the Voting Rights Act (VRA) that determined which jurisdictions had to presubmit changes in their election policies for federal approval. This ruling allowed covered counties full control over their election laws for the first time in 40 years. We engage the question of whether counties that had previously been ``covered'' purged voters at a higher rate than noncovered counties after the coverage formula was struck down. We find increases in purge rate of between 1.5 and 4.5 points in formerly covered jurisdictions post-Shelby, compared with counties that had not been subject to preclearance. Most of the increase came immediately, as the effect in 2014 is substantively and significantly higher than that in 2016. These findings suggest that while counties may have aggressively purged voters in 2014---the first election after the coverage formula's demise---they may have tempered this behavior thereafter.},

Critics of congressional redistricting have argued that recent partisan gerrymandering severely undermines electoral competitiveness to the point of violating constitutional equal protection standards. Method. We first analyze the legal precedents and arguments central to the contemporary redistricting debate. We then analyze district-level data measuring the change in a congressional incumbent's presidential party vote share before and after the 2000 redistricting. We conduct regression analyses that test for partisan and incumbent gerrymandering effects with an eye toward noting implications for the Voting Rights Act, particularly majority-minority districting. Results. We find that recent redistricting significantly contributed to a further decline in electoral competitiveness; however, most of this decline in competitiveness came through incumbency protection, not partisan gerrymandering. Majority-minority districts lost about 5 percent incumbent party vote share, though only 3 percent in southern states. Conclusion. Given these results, we conclude that the logic of partisan gerrymandering is at variance with the mandate of racial redistricting. One effect of establishing a strict judicial standard limiting statewide partisan biases would be to restrict states' capacity to draw majority-minority districts.},

This line of thinking suggests Brexit, like the electoral appeal of Donald Trump and parties such as the Five Star Movement, is but the latest manifestation of a growing disconnect between Western citizens and their democratic institutions. The direct role of political alienation in building support for such anti-establishment causes has, however, barely been examined. This study addresses this gap and uses previous literature on political alienation to build a model to test the claim that Brexit was (at least in part) driven by political alienation in UK citizens. The analyses show that while political alienation did have a substantial effect in making some citizens more likely to support Brexit---specifically those who lacked trust in the integrity of the political elite and felt that the political system was unresponsive---its impact overall was limited. Moreover, claims that Brexit was driven by political alienation understate how alienated from politics most people who were opposed to it also feel.},

The gray zone needs to be explored independently of the two extremes. Homogeneity is another aspect of comparing within and between various concepts and measures of the same phenomenon.

  abstract = {Social and ecological crises require people to act together, for instance, against climate change or social injustice. Psychological scholarship suggests that human agency, in terms of individuals? self-efficacy and collective efficacy, plays a crucial role in motivating people to act for a better world. However, progress in this field and hence the utilization of its accumulated knowledge is hindered by manifold conceptualizations and operationalizations. We therefore identify key problems in how the concept of self-efficacy has evolved and been used in the domain of environmental protection and then present a conceptual solution: the triple-A framework. This framework organizes and integrates theoretical insights by differentiating which agents, actions, and aims are involved in assessments of efficacy. We then illustrate the framework?s broader application and highlight recommendations for improved measurement of self-efficacy beliefs. We further offer a research agenda on how human agency can be utilized to promote social and ecological aims.Public AbstractMany people do not act together against climate change or social inequalities because they feel they or their group cannot make a difference. Understanding how people come to feel that they can achieve something (a perception of self-efficacy) is therefore crucial for motivating people to act together for a better world. However, it is difficult to summarize already existing self-efficacy research because previous studies have used many different ways of naming and measuring it. In this article, we uncover the problems that this raises and propose the triple-A framework as a solution. This new framework shows which agents, actions, and aims are important for understanding self-efficacy. By offering specific recommendations for measuring self-efficacy, the triple-A framework creates a basis for mobilizing human agency in the context of climate change and social injustice.},

But less is understood about the impact of such factors on attitudes towards government of racial and ethnic minorities. The passage of ballot initiatives targeting minority interests might be expected to have a negative effect on these groups. This study considers the impact of institutional and social context on attitudes about government responsiveness (external efficacy), drawing on pooled NES survey data from 1988--98 merged with state level data. Consistent with previous research, which was based on a single year, there is strong evidence that citizens in states with frequent exposure to direct democracy are more likely to perceive that government is responsive to their needs. At the same time, direct democracy did not have the hypothesized detrimental impact on racial and ethnic group attitudes towards government in general. State racial context also did not have a measurable impact on individual-level attitudes. Regardless of state environmental contexts, however, racial and ethnic minorities (with the exception of Latinos) reported less confidence in government than whites. The findings have broader implications, particularly given the growing racial and ethnic diversity and the ongoing politics of democratic inclusion in America.},

Instead, the maximum may be attained on the boundary of the parameter space where one or more of the unique variances are zero. It is demonstrated that suchimproper (Heywood) solutions occur more often than is usually expected. A general procedure to deal with such improper solutions is proposed. The proposed methods are illustrated using two small sets of empirical data, and results obtained from the analyses of many other sets of data are reported. These analyses verify that the new computational method converges rapidly and that the maximum likelihood solution can be determined very accurately. A by-product obtained by the method is a large sample estimate of the variance-covariance matrix of the estimated unique variances.

  abstract = {Political efficacy---the belief in one's ability to influence political outcomes---is an impactful predictor of support for democracy and political participation. However, the increasing rise of resentment politics---the belief that some groups are getting more than their fair share---may have dramatic consequences on citizens' efficacy. Using the American National Election Study, we find resentful voters decrease their sense of external efficacy, that is, their belief that someone like them can influence the system. These effects are particularly concentrated among white respondents. However, partisanship conditions the impact of resentment for internal efficacy, that is, their belief that they understand the political system sufficiently to effectively participate. For Republicans, resentment increases their internal efficacy, while Democratic voters see a decline in their beliefs about their own comprehension of the political system. These findings have important implications for understanding the multifaceted impacts of resentment politics on political attitudes and support for democratic systems.},

  abstract = {A lagged dependent variable in an OLS regression is often used as a means of capturing dynamic effects in political processes and as a method for ridding the model of autocorrelation. But recent work contends that the lagged dependent variable specification is too problematic for use in most situations. More specifically, if residual autocorrelation is present, the lagged dependent variable causes the coefficients for explanatory variables to be biased downward. We use a Monte Carlo analysis to assess empirically how much bias is present when a lagged dependent variable is used under a wide variety of circumstances. In our analysis, we compare the performance of the lagged dependent variable model to several other time series models. We show that while the lagged dependent variable is inappropriate in some circumstances, it remains an appropriate model for the dynamic theories often tested by applied analysts. From the analysis, we develop several practical suggestions on when and how to use lagged dependent variables on the right-hand side of a model.},

This poses two serious challenges. First, as with PCSTS, autocorrelation threatens inferences. However, common solutions like differencing and using a lagged dependent variable are not possible with RCS since lags for i cannot be used. Second, although RCS designs contain information that allows both aggregate- and individual-level analyses, available methods---from pooled ordinary least squares to PCSTS to time series---force researchers to choose one level of analysis. The PCSTS tool kit does not provide an appropriate solution, and we offer one here: double filtering with ARFIMA methods to account for autocorrelation in longer RCS followed by the use of multilevel modeling to estimate both aggregate- and individual-level parameters simultaneously. We use Monte Carlo experiments and three applied examples to explore the advantages of our framework.},

  abstract = {Public opinion studies have conventionally treated political efficacy as a two-dimensional concept involving internal and external efficacy. The former refers to people's beliefs about their individual abilities to understand politics, and the latter refers to people's beliefs about government responsiveness. The present study reexamines and goes beyond this two-dimensional view. It proposes that collective efficacy, defined as a citizen's belief in the capabilities of the public as a collective actor to achieve social and political outcomes, can be considered as a third dimension of political efficacy. Based on this three-dimensional view, the relationship between political efficacy, support for democratization, and political participation in Hong Kong is examined. Analysis of a representative survey (N = 800) shows that both support for democratization and political participation are positively related to collective efficacy and negatively related to external efficacy. Internal efficacy, on the other hand, has only a limited relationship with the dependent variables, though high levels of internal efficacy are found to be a condition for collective and external efficacy to exert stronger impact on political attitudes and behavior. It is argued that two characteristics of the Hong Kong society---as a transitional society and a collectivist culture---contribute to the significance of collective efficacy in the public opinion process. But the relevance of collective efficacy to other contexts is also discussed.},

Chicago Latinos report lower feelings of political efficacy on an internal efficacy item and on one of two external efficacy items than do most national groups, but much higher levels of external efficacy on the remaining item. There are also interesting differences in responses among groups within the Chicago Latino community. Also, Chicago Latinos do not exhibit the same link between external efficacy and voting as has been found for Anglos. Conclusions. Chicago Latinos feel that their political reality is one of relatively high empowerment, and they tend to view voting as more of a symbolic act than as an instrumental one.},

Further, the results of an order experiment in the survey suggest that responses are unaffected by mode of presentation. In short, the four new questions constitute the most satisfactory measure of internal political efficacy to date.},

However, scholars do not yet fully understand the reasons for its decline. Nor have they found suitable explanations for why it fluctuates within the electorate. Drawing on the growing literature on the effects of income inequality on public policy, I posit that increasing income inequality factors into the decline of external political efficacy. Using multilevel regression models accounting for individual and contextual factors, I find increasing state-level income inequality has a substantial negative effect on external political efficacy. It is greater than most state and national-level economic measures or individual-level variables on external political efficacy. These results have important implications both for research on income inequality and political participation and also for research on income inequality and distributional public policy., Aux \'Etats-Unis, l'efficacit\'e politique ext\'erieure---la conviction que le gouvernement r\'epond aux demandes de ses citoyens---est en constant d\'eclin depuis les ann\'ees soixante. N\'eanmoins, les chercheurs ne comprennent pas compl\`etement les raisons de ce d\'eclin. Ils n'ont pas trouv\'e non plus d'explications satisfaisantes \`a ces fluctuations parmi les \'electeurs. En faisant appel au volume croissant de la litt\'erature au sujet des effets de l'in\'egalit\'e de revenus sur la politique publique, je pose comme principe que l'augmentation de l'in\'egalit\'e des revenus contribue au d\'eclin de l'efficacit\'e politique ext\'erieure. En utilisant les mod\`eles de r\'egression \`a plusieurs niveaux pour les facteurs individuels autant que contextuels, je trouve que l'augmentation de l'in\'egalit\'e des revenus au niveau des \'Etats a un effet n\'egatif fondamental sur l'efficacit\'e politique ext\'erieure. Cet effet a un impact sur l'efficacit\'e politique ext\'erieure plus important que celui de la plupart des mesures \'economiques au niveau national ou \'etatique, ou que celui des variables au niveau individuel. Ces r\'esultats ont des implications importantes sur la recherche sur l'in\'egalit\'e des revenus et la participation politique, ainsi que sur la recherche sur l'in\'egalit\'e des revenus et la politique publique de distribution.},

We propose a specific concept and operationalization of racial group efficacy, and we distinguish this concept from racial identity, group consciousness, and conventional efficacy measures. Analyses of data from the 2016 Collaborative Multiracial Post-Election Survey reveal that for white, Black, Asian, and Latina/o Americans, racial efficacy is a more consistent and robust predictor of political participation than standard internal and external efficacy measures. Further, we show that racial efficacy exhibits associations with conventional and unconventional forms of participation that distinguish whites from people of color. We conclude by discussing how people's racial efficacy informs their engagement in politics, from voting to protests.},

We present a framework to test this assumption and correct scales when it fails to hold. Examining 13 commonly used scales on the 2012 and 2016 American National Elections Studies, we find widespread violations of the equivalence assumption. These violations often bias the estimated magnitude or direction of theoretically important group differences.

In the 2024 rankings, Oregon remains the most accessible state for voters, while Mississippi is now the most restrictive. Furthermore, the research uncovers a trend of increasing polarization in voting accessibility, with Republican-controlled states generally enacting more stringent voting laws and Democratic-controlled states adopting more voter-friendly measures.},

This research updates work which established the relative ``cost of voting'' during presidential election cycles, in each of the 50 states, from 1996 to 2016. The 2020 iteration takes into account the recent adoption of automatic voter registration processes, expansion of early voting, new absentee voting laws, and the elimination of polling stations in some states. We learn that Oregon, which has one of the most progressive automatic voter registration processes and mail-in voting, maintains the first position as the easiest state in which to vote. Texas falls to 50th, in part because it does not keep pace with reforms like online voter registration and no excuse absentee voting, which have taken place in most other states. Voters in both Michigan and Virginia will find voting more hassle free in 2020 because of changes to both voter registration and balloting processes that have occurred since 2016.},

  abstract = {The ease of voting across the American States is constantly changing. This research updates work that established the relative ``cost of voting'' during presidential election cycles, in each of the 50 states, from 1996 to 2020. A 2022 iteration is necessary to consider the flurry of new legislative initiatives that passed state legislatures after the 2020 election cycle. Many states made voting easier by codifying changes composed in response to the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic. Other states, over concerns about voter fraud and seemingly at the prompting of former President Donald Trump, took a step backward and made voting more difficult. We learn that Oregon, which has the most progressive automatic voter registration process and all-mail voting, maintains the first position as the easiest state to vote in. Mississippi (49th) and New Hampshire (50th) stay at the bottom of the rankings as the most difficult states for voting. Their failure to move is largely due to these states failing to keep pace with reforms like online voter registration, no excuse absentee voting, and automatic voter registration, which have taken place in other states. Voters in Vermont will find voting much less challenging in 2022 as the state has adopted nearly all the progressive reforms used in other states that make voting easier, not the least of which is an all-mail balloting process.},

In this article, we draw on theories of electoral accountability to evaluate the effect of Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, the preclearance provision, on the representation of Black interests in the 86th to 105th congresses. We find that members of Congress who represented jurisdictions subject to the preclearance requirement were substantially more supportive of civil rights--related legislation than legislators who did not represent covered jurisdictions. Moreover, we report that the effects were stronger when Black voters composed larger portions of the electorate and in more competitive districts. This result is robust to a wide range of model specifications and empirical strategies, and it persists over the entire time period under study. Our findings have especially important implications given the Supreme Court's recent decision in Shelby County v. Holder.},

However, the concept of content validity has been controversial since its inception. The current unitary conceptualization of validity argues against use of the term content validity, but stresses the importance of content representation in the instrument construction and evaluation processes. However, by arguing against use of this term, the importance of demonstrating content representativeness has been severely undermined. This paper reviews the history of content validity theory to underscore its importance in evaluating construct validity. It is concluded that although measures cannot be "validated" based on content validity evidence alone, demonstration of content validity is a fundamental requirement of all assessment instruments.},

Meehl (1955) advocated for the concept of construct validity, noting that psychologists study hypothetical, inferred entities and that validating measures of such entities involves basic theory testing.

First, clinical research has benefited from greater theoretical integration and subsequent differentiation among related constructs. Second, implementation of ongoing, critical evaluation of all aspects of the construct validity process, including theory development, hypothesis specification, research design, and empirical evaluation, has improved clinical assessment. Third, improvement in evaluating fit between hypotheses and observations has been sought. Improved means of evaluating multitrait, multimethod designs, and ways to increase their clinical representativeness, are one encouraging development. Ongoing efforts to improve the construct validity process reflect the legacy of L. J. Cronbach and P. E. Meehl.},

These are: the emergence of nonjustificationist philosophy of science; an increasing appreciation for theory and the need for informative tests of construct validity; valid construct representation in experimental psychopathology; the need to avoid representing multidimensional constructs with a single score; and the emergence of effective new statistical tools for the evaluation of convergent and discriminant validity.},

Analyses limited to recent movers are then reported to understand more fully the forces associated with the actual decision calculi of registering and voting. The influences of many factors commonly accepted as important determinants of voting are disentangled, and their effect at each stage is ascertained. Factors yielding inconsistent effects in previous research or believed to be unimportant-such as race, gender, attitudes toward the candidates, and trust in government-are shown to deserve closer scrutiny by electoral scholars.},

For some voters, options like mail-in or no-excuse absentee voting were familiar; for others, they were novel. While scholars have explored how election reforms affect turnout, we know less about how state-level electoral policies influence people's political efficacy and trust, and how political context and voter partisanship condition those effects. Employing a policy feedback framework, our analysis combines original data on state changes to election procedures with ANES survey data from 1988 to 2020 to understand the context-specific effects of voting access reforms on people's political efficacy and trust. Using time-event difference-in-difference analysis, we find little evidence that electoral reforms affect political efficacy and trust overall; however, partisanship and state political context appear necessary to understand the true relationship between electoral reform and political behavior.},

Owing to the rapid expansion of political activities in the last decades this question has become increasingly difficult to answer. Neither the development of all-embracing nominal definitions, nor deductive analyses of existing modes of participation seem to be helpful. In addition, the spread of expressive modes of participation makes it hard to avoid purely subjective definitions. The aim of this discussion paper is to develop an operational definition of political participation, which allows us to cover distinct conceptualizations systematically, efficiently and consistently. This goal can only be arrived at if the conventional approach of presenting nominal definitions to solve conceptual problems is left behind. Instead, available definitions are included in a set of decision rules to distinguish three main variants of political participation. A fourth variant is distinguished for non-political activities used for political purposes. Together, the four variants of political participation cover the whole range of political participation systematically without excluding any mode of political participation unknown yet. At the same time, the endless expansion of the modes of political participation in modern democracies does not result in an endless conceptual expansion. Implications for research and various examples are discussed.},

Three meta-analyses synthesized a total of 182 effects of perceived injustice, efficacy, and identity on collective action (corresponding to these socio-psychological perspectives). Results showed that, in isolation, all 3 predictors had medium-sized (and causal) effects. Moreover, results showed the importance of social identity in predicting collective action by supporting SIMCA's key predictions that (a) affective injustice and politicized identity produced stronger effects than those of non-affective injustice and non-politicized identity; (b) identity predicted collective action against both incidental and structural disadvantages, whereas injustice and efficacy predicted collective action against incidental disadvantages better than against structural disadvantages; (c) all 3 predictors had unique medium-sized effects on collective action when controlling for between-predictor covariance; and (d) identity bridged the injustice and efficacy explanations of collective action. Results also showed more support for SIMCA than for alternative models reflecting previous attempts at theoretical integration. The authors discuss key implications for theory, practice, future research, and further integration of social and psychological perspectives on collective action.

I will argue that operationalism is not a viable strategy and instead will put the case for a realist approach to definition and measurement in survey research.},
