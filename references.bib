  abstract = {The literature on political efficacy has long grappled with this question: what is the difference between internal and external political efficacy, and what are the best ways to measure these concepts? Though a quality measure of internal efficacy has been devised, external efficacy, as measured by the National Elections Studies (NES), is still questioned. In this study, a lagged dependent variable model is used to test the measure from an aggregate and dynamic perspective. The results show that aggregate external efficacy is not currently responsive to changes in the political environment. This leads to the conclusion that the measure of external efficacy supported by the NES needs to be studied more thoroughly.},

  abstract = {Theories of political culture have traditionally been based on how the mass public views the role of government, yet scholars have rarely studied this issue. Using American National Election Studies(ANES) data from 1952 to 2008, I track cultural changes in external efficacy, a measure of the public's beliefs about government responsiveness. The aggregate- and individual-level results indicate that external efficacy varied across political cultures until around 1980, when the differences dissipated. These findings should cause scholars to question some of the underlying theoretical basis of political culture, as well as the measurement of external efficacy.},
